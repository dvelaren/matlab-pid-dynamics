# matlab-pid-dynamics
This Matlab script and simulink allows to plot the system response to a proportional, integral and derivative controller

To execute, download the entire folder and run the Dynamics.m script. It will automatically generate 3 plots, each one with P, P+I, P+I+D actions and all the system signals (SP, Y, E).

Open Dynamics.m or PIDDynamics.slx to adjust parameters.
